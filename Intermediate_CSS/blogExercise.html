        <p class="quote">Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
            it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
            that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're
            in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>
        <p>The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island.
            Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
            the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

        <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
            can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends,
            like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me
            Mr Glass. </p>

        <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
            and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when
            we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we
            took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't.
            Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>
